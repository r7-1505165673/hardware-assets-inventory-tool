# --- Wait for the address APP_URL names --------------------------------------
# The Elastic IP is allocated before this instance (user_data has to be able to
# name it) and associated a moment after it starts, which is somewhere in the
# middle of this script. Until then the instance is on a different auto-assigned
# address, and every connection open across the swap dies — a `dnf install`
# among them. So the first thing to do here is nothing, until the swap lands.
#
# The token has to outlive the loop that uses it. At 300 seconds it expires on
# the last iteration of a 60 × 5 s wait, and the `|| true` below would swallow
# the 401 — turning "the address never arrived" into "the token died", which
# reads identically in the log and is not the same problem.
#
# And the token is fetched under `set -e`, so a single refused connection to an
# IMDS endpoint that is not quite up yet ends the boot right here — no
# container, and a last log line about curl. Hence the retries.
